# anndata_frontend_ui

A new Flutter application.

# Anndata
# Introduction:-
In the current scenario, fruits & vegetables arrive at the market through a manual calling system or agents. The farmers have to contact the cold storage/warehouse people through an agent to sell their fruit & vegetables. The agent contacts the carriers so that they can transport fruits & vegetables. Through this process, the farmer is able to connect with the cold storage/warehouse. Furthermore, for selling fruits & vegetables through agents, the cold storage/warehouses people also have to contact the wholesaler (aadat), they have to contact the retailers and finally the resident.
So, rather than reaching the agents, the farmer/cold storage/warehouse/wholesaler/ retailer can legitimately interface with everyone on a platform according to their purchasing ability and thus, The process can run smoothly by transporters. We aim to make interlink between all the people who made this process successful from farmers to the residents through an android app using the flutter framework. So to make this possible we have implemented an app using flutter framework and a website through mern stack.
# Problem Statement:-
In the present time what happens is that the fruits & vegetables arrive at the market through a manual calling system or agents. The farmers have to contact the cold storage/warehouse people through an agent to sell their fruit & vegetables. The agent contacts the carriers so that they can transport fruits & vegetables. Through this process, the farmer is able to connect with the cold storage/warehouse. Furthermore, for selling fruits & vegetables through agents, the cold storage/warehouses people also have to contact the wholesaler (aadat), they have to contact the retailers and finally the resident.
# Proposed System:-
In the existing system, residents buy fruits & vegetables either from retailers or through online preexisting startups like Big basket. As the farmers are not able to contact cold storage people very easily without hiring any agents, this results in the spoilage of fruits & vegetables. According to the research I have done, in most of the current startups, residents receive fruits & vegetables directly from farmers. As many of the residents go to their local market to buy the best quality of fruits & vegetables, they don't prefer to deliver at their homes too.
 So, to overcome this problem and  create more job opportunities, we aim to make an android application which connects all the people from farmers to residents. We aim to democratize the jobs rather than cutting them. So, the farmer/cold storage/warehouse/wholesaler/retailer can connect with everyone on one platform. According to the demand of the market, each one of them can order without wasting any sort of time.
